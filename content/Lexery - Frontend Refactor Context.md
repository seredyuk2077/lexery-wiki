# Lexery - Frontend Refactor Context

## Source

- Linear document:
  `Main Refactor -> Feature Integration Context Packet`
- Date:
  `2026-03-15`

## Central Situation

Frontend was moving in two parallel tracks:

- architecture/refactor track led by Yehor
- feature/UI track led by [[Lexery - Olexandr|Olexandr]]

## The Core Problem

If Olexandr’s feature branch were merged directly into refactored main, the team risked:

- reintroducing old patterns
- breaking visual/system consistency
- duplicating state/data-access logic
- causing another cleanup cycle immediately after merge

## The Intended Solution

- finish refactor baseline in main
- freeze new feature coding during integration window
- port feature work onto refactored structure
- merge only when integrated branch is technically green and structurally consistent
- document patterns and anti-patterns for future AI-assisted work

## Why This Matters To The Wiki

- `Observed`:
  frontend architecture was treated as a strategic operating concern.
- `Observed`:
  repo docs were expected to act as guardrails for future AI-generated code.
- `Inferred`:
  this is one of the strongest examples of Lexery treating architecture as team memory, not only code style.
