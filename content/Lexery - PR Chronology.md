## Observations

### Cadence and process

- Roughly **one PR per day** across the window — high throughput, small batches.
- **All PRs target `dev`** — no merges recorded to `main` / `master` in this ledger; release strategy may be tag-based or a separate promotion step not shown here.
- **Prefixes:** `[Frontend]`, `[Backend]`, `[Agent]` — easy filtering in GitHub and aligns with [[Lexery - Team and Operating Model|team lanes]].

### Merge latency

- **Same-day or next-day merge** is typical once review passes.
- PR **#9** (*auth infra*) remained **Open** at snapshot time — track resolution and whether it supersedes #8.

### Hygiene

- **~6 stale branches** from merged PRs are candidates for deletion to reduce noise vs [[Lexery - Branch Divergence]].
- **Brain-heavy work** on `legal-agent-brain-dev` often **does not appear** as Lexery PRs — significant runtime changes are **local / alternate remote**; see [[Lexery - GitHub History]] and [[Lexery - Current State]].

## Українською (коротко)

**Каденція:** близько одного PR на день, усі в `dev`. **Префікси:** Frontend / Backend / Agent. **Виняток:** Brain часто в `legal-agent-brain-dev` без PR у цьому репо — див. [[Lexery - GitHub History|історію GitHub]].
