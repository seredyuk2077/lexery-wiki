  main repo history itself records monorepo assembly as separate waves:
  frontend migration, legal-agent migration, backend foundation, shared contracts, auth, plans.
- `Observed`:
  `legal-agent-brain-dev` remains a named long-lived branch in remote, not only local.
- `Inferred`:
  the monorepo was assembled by pulling together previously separate technical lines.
